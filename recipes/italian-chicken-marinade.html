<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This Italian dressing chicken marinade is a super simple but delicious way to add flavor before grilling.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow baking dish; add chicken breasts and turn to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade.</li>
    <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>

    <li>Preheat the grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Remove pork tenderloins from marinade; shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
    <li>Cook pork tenderloins on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 20 to 30 minutes, turning occasionally. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
